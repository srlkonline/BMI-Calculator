# Python Projects – Data Cleaning, EDA & Web Scraping

This repository showcases Python-based projects focused on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and web scraping. The goal is to extract, prepare, and explore data to uncover meaningful insights and support further analysis.



# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

-Handling missing or null values

-Removing duplicates and irrelevant records

-Standardizing data types and formats

-Dealing with outliers and inconsistent entries



# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

-Descriptive statistics and summary metrics

-Data visualization for trends and patterns

-Correlation analysis and feature relationships

-Grouped and time-based analysis



# Web Scraping:

-Extracting structured data from dynamic and static websites

-Parsing HTML content using BeautifulSoup, Selenium, or Scrapy

-Cleaning and storing scraped data in structured formats (CSV, JSON, or databases)



# Tools & Libraries Used:

-Python – Core programming language

-Pandas & NumPy – For data manipulation and cleaning

-Matplotlib & Seaborn – For data visualization during EDA

-BeautifulSoup / Requests / Selenium / Scrapy – For web scraping

-Jupyter Notebook – For code execution and reporting

-SQLite / CSV / JSON – For storing cleaned or scraped data

-Optional: Regular Expressions, tqdm, time, lxml, and other scraping utilities
